# Real-Time Route Simulation

This project is a real-time route simulation application built with React and the Google Maps API. It allows users to visualize and simulate routes between two points on a map, complete with dynamic updates of the car's position along the route.

## Features

- **Dynamic Route Simulation:** Simulate routes in real-time, with the ability to adjust the speed of simulation.
- **Interactive Map Interface:** Utilize an interactive map interface powered by the Google Maps API for route visualization.
- **Customizable Markers:** Add custom markers to highlight important locations or stops along the route.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

**React:** Utilized as the frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces.

**Google Maps API:** Integrated to provide mapping functionality, including route calculation and visualization.

**React Google Maps API:** Leveraged to simplify the integration of Google Maps functionality into the React application.

**React Loader Spinner:** Used to display loading indicators during route calculation and data fetching.
